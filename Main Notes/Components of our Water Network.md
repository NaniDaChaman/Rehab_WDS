## Rural piped networks 

- [ ] What is the goal of our design ? 
- [ ] Explain the direction of water flow problem ? 
- [ ] Explain water source component of the network ?
- can be surface / ground water ,etc 
- assumed to provide constant head
- [ ] Explain water treatment plant 
- sorce->wtp
- it has type (type of treatment it recieves) and capacity (amount of water treated per day )
- ignored here as we don't care about water quality 
- [ ] explain MBR ? 
- effective sourc of water from the network 
- wtp->mbr
- need to decide are its location, elevation and size 
- [ ] explain esr ? 
- are tanks which take water supplied from mbr and deliver it to the villages 
- can server 1+ villages 
- assume that each esr is served by the source and each demand point is served by 1.0 esr 
- [ ] pipes ?
- provide water to and fro between junctions 
- as water flows through pipe headloss occurs across the length of the pipe 
- headloss depends on type,flow ,ect detemined by Hazen-Williams equation 
- ==maybe mention the dc equations==
- typed of pipes 
- we wanna minimize the cost of installation for each pipe here ! 
- other consideration should be water quality and corrosiveness of the pipes 
- [ ] pumps/valves ? 
- help add additinal head across a given link to supply water where it might not be able to be supplied with pipes / tanks 
- One of the primary sources o opex cost and are big marginal cost for the system 
- assumed to be increasing linearly with as a function of the head provided 
- in practivce varies with different water  flow and head and is given by the charectaristic curve 
- [ ] Additional assumptions : 
- aggregate demand of a village and distributed demand is not considered 
- demand at each point is known  and constant throughout a day (steady state analysis) => need to do an extended period simulation to verify the optimal functioning of the network 
- network is branched demand points are known and fixed  => fixes the flow of pipes acrosss the networks .
