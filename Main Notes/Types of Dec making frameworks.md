## Anthony's Framework
- Strategic Planning : Long term decision that decide how a process is going to be operated ,provides constrains for all the lower level decisions
- Tactical Planning : medium term decisions, they make decisions on allocating available resources from strategic planning based on upcoming demand and supply. 
- Operational control : day to day operation and scheduling decisions, converted managerial policies and resource allocation to daily ops


### How to formulate math programs ? 
- Selecting time horizon : how long do we have to look into the future to account for all significant factors of decision under study. 
- The more we will look into the future the more our current decisions shall consider future impact (reward)
- e.g. : capital investment : 10-20 years, workforce scheduling 10 years 
- Divide the time horizon : this can be done to reflect changes that might happen in our model for each of the time horizon which might give us a parametric  answer !!!

### dec vars and parameters : 
- vars are those values which can set by the decision maker 
- parameters are those values which are given to the decision maker !!!
- choosing a decision vars : is very important as it can transform a non linear prog into a linear one
- parameters : they are assumed to be fixed for the time we are using a linear program
