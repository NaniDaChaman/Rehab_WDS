## Tanks 
- Its a water storage facility : takes in water and gives it out based on its demand !!!
- They can not only represent a tank (an elevated storage facility) but also a ==ground levels== underground storage facility and other stuff 
- In steady state analysis : tanks water levels are fixed !!! (incoming water = outgoing water) : head of a tank is fixed !!!
- In Extended state analyses : tank levels vary !!!

## Pumps
- Basically bring water to higher elevation and increase their head flow rate !!
- Suction and discharge pipes ??
## Hydralic components of models Questions

- How do we model non pipe elements !!!
- [ ] What is HGL ? 
- Its the potential energy at a given point in a pipeline at a particular point !!!
- $HGL = P/r(Pressure applied by the top of the pipeline!!!) + z(elevation)$
